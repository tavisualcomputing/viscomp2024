    "## Useful information for this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "For basics about images as numpy arrays, please refer to the second week's tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "With numpy it is also possible to refer to slices of a given array by specifying the kept dimensions in the slice with `:`. For example, if we want to access the red channel of an RGB image `im` with shape `(height, width, 3)`, we can write `im[:, :, 0]`, which refers to the whole image data for the red channel only. We can optionally specify a range to be kept along a direction by writing the extreme indices around the `:` as in `min:max`. For example, accessing a patch within the pixel coordinates `(h0, w0)`, `(h1, w1)` with h0 < h1 and w0 < w1 can be done with `im[h0:h1, w0:w1, :]`.<br>\n",
    "You can also index arrays based on conditions: for example to set to black all pixels with a blue component higher than 200 you can write `im[im[:, :, 2] > 200] = 0`.<br>\n",
    "These references can be used both for reading an image slice and for writing a whole slice at once, without looping over it. <br>\n",
    "A complete reference of numpy basic and advanced indexing rules (not necessary for this tutorial, but very useful for numpy python programming) can be found in https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.indexing.html\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing operations between numpy arrays, all operations are executed element-wise (except for the `@` operator that performs the usual matrix multiplication). This requires the shapes (dimensions) of the involved arrays to match or to be compatible according to broadcasting rules, which are usually intuitive. An example of broadcasting is when adding a pixel value `p=np.array([70, 128, 255])` to an image `im` with shape `(height, width, 3)`: the operation is legal and the pixel value is added independently to each pixel in the image. <br>\n",
    "A complete reference of numpy broadcasting rules (not necessary for this tutorial, but very useful for numpy python programming) can be found in https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html . \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we list some useful functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Array initialization:<br>\n",
    "`np.array(a, dtype)`: returns a copy of `a` as a numpy array. Argument `a` does not need to be a numpy array, it can be any array-like object, e.g. a python list. It is possible to specify a `dtype` argument in case we want to change the type of the original array in the returned copy. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html<br>\n",
    "`np.empty(shape, dtype)`: returns a new empty array with specified shape `shape` and the specified data type `dtype`. For this tutorial we suggest using as dtype `np.int16` for images and default for the rest. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.empty.html<br>\n",
    "`np.ones(shape, dtype)`: returns a new array filled with ones with specified shape `shape` and the specified data type `dtype`. For this tutorial we suggest using as dtype `np.int16` for images and default for the rest. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html<br>\n",
    "`np.zeros(shape, dtype)`: returns a new array filled with zeros with specified shape `shape` and the specified data type `dtype`. For this tutorial we suggest using as dtype `np.int16` for images and default for the rest. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html<br>\n",
    "`np.eye(N)` : builds the identity matrix of order `N`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.eye.html<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Array shape management:<br>\n",
    "`np.reshape(a, newshape)`: returns a reshaped view of the input array `a` having shape `newshape`, which should be specified as a tuple of integers. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html<br>\n",
    "`np.transpose(a)`: returns the transposed of array `a`, whose shape has reversed order with respect to `a`. Alias `a.T`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.transpose.html<br>\n",
    "`np.expand_dims(a, axis)`: returns the same array `a` with a new dimension of size one along the specified `axis`. You can use `np.newaxis` when slice-indexing `a` for the same result. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Array reductors:<br>\n",
    "`np.linalg.norm(x)`: returns the L2 norm of array `x`. You can also specify a keyword argument `axis` to compute the norm only along a specific dimension (the result will have the same shape as `x`, but without the specified dimension) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html<br>\n",
    "`np.sum(a)` : returns the sum of all the elements of array `a`. You can specify a keyword argument `axis` to compute the sum only along a specific dimension (the result will have the same shape as `a`, but without the specified dimension) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html<br>\n",
    "`np.mean(a)` : returns the mean value of all the elements of array `a`. You can specify a keyword argument `axis` to compute the mean only along a specific dimension (the result will have the same shape as `a`, but without the specified dimension) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix operations:<br>\n",

    "`scipy.ndimage.shift(input, shift)`: returns a copy of `input` image shifted by the translation vector `shift`. Argument `shift` is in pixels, it can be not integer, in which case the result is interpolated. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.shift.html<br>\n",
    "`scipy.ndimage.label(input, structure)`: Segment the connected components in `input` image, considering all zero-values as separation elements. The `structure` parameter is a central-symmetric array with ones and zeros that defines when two parts are to be considered connected or not (i.e. component_1 is connected with component_2 if we can center the `structure` array on a pixel in component_1 and have at least a one in `structure` to overlap with a pixel in component_2). This function returns both the segmented image, assigning to each pixel an integer identifying its own connected component label, and the number of distinct connected components found. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.label.html<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean array operations:<br>\n",
    "`np.logical_and(x1, x2)`: where `x1` and `x2` are arrays of boolean values with matching or broadcastable shape, it returns the element-wise logical and operation between `x1` and `x2`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html<br>\n",
    "`np.isin(element, test_elements)`: for each element in array `element` check whether it is contained into the array-like `test_elements`, and returns an array of boolean values of the same shape as `element`. Warning: with non-sequence `test_elements` like python sets, it produces incorrect results without throwing any exception. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.isin.html<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Miscellaneous:<br>\n",
    "`np.around(a, decimals)`: rounds a floating-point array `a` to the specified number of `decimals` (zero decimals by default). Returns again a floating point array. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.around.html<br>\n",
    "`np.max(x1, x2)`: where `x1` and `x2` are arrays with matching or broadcastable shape, it returns the element-wise maximum into an array with the same (or broadcasted) shape as the inputs. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.maximum.html<br>\n",
    "`np.pi`: the usual constant for the ratio between circumference and diameter of a circle. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/constants.html#numpy.pi<br>\n",
    "`np.arctan2(x1, x2)`: element-wise arctan of `x1/x2` choosing the quadrant correctly. Values returned are in the range `[-pi, pi]`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arctan2.html<br>"
